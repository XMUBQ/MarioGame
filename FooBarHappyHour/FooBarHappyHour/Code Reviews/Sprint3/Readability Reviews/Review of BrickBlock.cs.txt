Comments:
This class overall is very readable and I think that it would not be very hard for anyone to get up to speed on what this class does.
The main review is going to be over the readability of the CollisionWithMario method because of the use of a switch statements. I think that
this sort of switch statement could be broken down to possibly one if statement that would reduce the amount of lines that have to be read.
If the use of this method was more complex and would result in multiple if statements then I think breaking it down into a switch would be better,
but as it stands a single if could accomplish what this is doing.
