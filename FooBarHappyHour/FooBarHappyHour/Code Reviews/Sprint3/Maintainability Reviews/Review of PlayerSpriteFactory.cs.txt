*Class is almost 300 lines so just look at it instead.*

Comments: 
I think that this class has been hard to maintain mostly because of the amount of variables
and methods required for the factory. When a new spritesheet gets added there are three
steps to getting the factory to work with it and with the amount of states the sprites can be in
results in a state explosion of variables and methods. I think our factories in general will need
a rewrite at some point because it takes a while to get new states setup. Maybe a data driven
approach where we only have to write out what a sprite is at one point instead of three
might help us maintain it over the rest of the semester. That sort of refactor would not only help
the PlayerSpriteFactory class, but all of our factories.
