            foreach (string str in inputQueue)
            {

Comments: Actually we fixed lots of cheat code issue in this implementation. But this could be a 
performance issue if there's a great number of string concatenation. Our queue is not that long, 
however, we do it in every update so maybe it's little time-consuming.
