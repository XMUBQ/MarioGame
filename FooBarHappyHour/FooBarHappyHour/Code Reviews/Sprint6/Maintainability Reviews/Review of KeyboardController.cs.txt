This class right now is pretty straight forward and I think that right now it isn't a problem. The problem is that in the future if this class were to
be extended then I think that there would be maintainability issues. As of right now both players input is handled here and I think a more generic breakdown
would be beneficial to do so that multiple players could be added easier.
