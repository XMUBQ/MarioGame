            this.gameStateManager = gameStateManager;
        }

        public void Execute(PlayerSelection playerSelection)

This class as most of Commands class do only one thing and can be reduced to one line of code. I think having to move between folder each time we want to add
commands is really unnecessary especially for commands that being issued by one type of controllers. 

I recommend in such case to use a map between commands and action instead of what is being done here. How cheat codes map implemented for example.
