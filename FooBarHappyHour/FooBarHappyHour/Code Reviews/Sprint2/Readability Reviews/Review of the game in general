Comments:


1) Sprite Factories
I believe that giving the similarity of the sprites factories we might want to combine all factories into single factory class.

2) States and classes

Many part of the game seem repetitive. For instance, both Mario and enemy classes/states share very much same methods. 
Same is true for items and block classes. It might a good idea to consider combine some of these classes to ease readability and 
reduce redundancy.
