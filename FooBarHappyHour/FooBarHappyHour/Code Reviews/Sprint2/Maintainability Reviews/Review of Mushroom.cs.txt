Comments:
I feel like this class is unneeded as each mushroom in the game does a different thing and the coupling between mushroom class and other 
specific color mushroom classes only introduce high coupling and makes it difficult to maintain code in the future. Mushrooms are just like other items
and eventually each will result in different action when hit by Mario. My recommendation is to implement 
green/red mushrooms as separate items and delete mushroom class.
